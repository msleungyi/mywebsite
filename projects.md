### Multiverse Analysis of Developmental Dyslexia Subtyping Methods
I serve as the co-PI of this project alongside Dr. Daniel Kristanto (University of Oldenburg). Our work is supported by the Treasure Box Funding for Early Career Researchers under the priority programme META-REP (SPP 2317), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

This project reviews the range of data preprocessing techniques, statistical models, and specifications used in subtyping developmental dyslexia from a cognitive-behavioral perspective. It also examines the robustness of subtyping outcomes by exploring the "garden of forking paths" within the multiverse of subtyping methods.

We are currently developing a Shiny App to visualise the multiverse of developmental dyslexia subtyping methods. See **[here](https://dyslexiaproject.shinyapps.io/profilingdyslexia/)** for our demo Shiny App.

### Quantification of Heterogeneity in Ontological Definitions of Research Terms
The work is part of my doctoral project, "Falsifiability of Cognitive Causal Theories of Developmental Dyslexia" (PI: Dr. Xenia Schmalz), funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to quantify the variability in ontological definitions of research terms. These terms encompass concepts related to interdisciplinary research practices, statistical tests, and open scholarship.

In collaboration with Dr. Daniel Kristanto, we are developing a Shiny app, "Re-SearchTerms", to visualise the diverse definitions of research terms extracted from academic sources. This app aims to aid researchers in comparing the language used in these definitions, fostering greater clarity and consistency in defining concepts for future academic work. Check out the demo version of our Shiny App: **[Re-SearchTerms](https://msleungyi.shinyapps.io/Re-SearchTerms/)** The preprint is also now available **[here](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/qsp7x)**.
